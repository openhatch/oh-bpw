<h2>Sponsors</h2>

<p>We go to great lengths to run a professional, welcoming event. That includes providing a sponsored lunch for attendees and letting attendees know that they are part of a large, welcoming professional Python community. We also run wrap-up events so that organizers can discuss what to improve next time.</p>

<p>This takes time, space, and money. We're grateful to our sponsors so far who have made this possible.</p>

<h2>Volunteers and attendees</h2>

<p>The Boston Python Workshop is made possible by a huge crew of volunteers. We want to thank our teaching staff, sponsors, and attendees for letting us make a difference in the programming community.</p>

<h2>Can you or your company contribute?</h2>

<p>We are looking for new sponsors to help us maintain the energy in Boston and spread the workshop to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Can you or your company provide support to help us do that?
