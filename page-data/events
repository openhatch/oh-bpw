<h2>Upcoming</h2>

<p>Our audience is women and their friends who have no or limited programming experience. This event is welcoming and respectful of trans women. Men are welcome as guests of women who are attending.</p>

<p>The next Boston Python Workshop is expected to take place during November. When sign-ups open, we'll announce it on the Boston Python list. So:</p>

<p class="join_bospy"><a href="http://meetup.bostonpython.com/">Join the Boston Python user group &raquo;</a></p>

<h2>Event structure</h2>

<p>The Boston Python Workshop is a 1.5 day project-driven workshop. It consists of two components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Friday evening: laptop setup</li>
<li>Saturday morning + afternoon: Python lecture and hands-on, guided project practice</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the workshop, we invite all attendees to Boston Python's monthly project night, where you can continue practicing and learning. Attendees also receive invitations to Boston Python's monthly lecture-style events.</p>

<h2>Volunteers</h2>

<p>These are free events staffed by volunteers from the local programming and open source communities. We work closely with the
<a href="http://meetup.bostonpython.com/">Boston Python</a>, a large local Python user group. The event is part of the <a href="about/">OpenHatch event series</a>.</p>

<p>You can join us! If you want to be friendly to new programmers -- even if you're not yet an experienced programmer -- email our staff list: <a href="mailto:bpw-staff@lists.openhatch.org">bpw-staff@lists.openhatch.org</a>.</p>
