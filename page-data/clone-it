<h2>Do diversity outreach</h2>

<p>Python programming user groups are often overwhelmingly male. The success of our Workshop shows that you can change this.</p>

<p>We believe our success hinges on:</p>

<ul>
<li>A pool of helpful volunteers</li>
<li>Practical, well-tested projects</li>
<li>Solid documentation for how to set up a development environment</li>
<li>The full support of the Boston Python user group</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more of the <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2011/07/02/lessons-learned-from-the-boston-python-workshop-an-outreach-event-for-women/">lessons we have learned</a> in an article on Geek Feminism.</p>

<h2>How the event has spread</h2>

<p>Since Asheesh <a href="http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4259/pycon-2011-get-new-contributor">spoke about the effort at PyCon 2011</a>, people around the world have started efforts inspired by ours. We've:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inspired <a href="http://pystar.org/">PyStar</a> to form and organize outreach events</li>
<li>Worked with Montreal Python to organize an <a href="http://montrealpython.org/2011/05/a-success-introduction-to-python-for-women/">Introduction to Python for Women</a></li>
<li>Traveled to Philadelphia to help teach at <a href="http://www.thehacktory.org/?p=1470">PyStar Philadelphia</a></li>
<li>Inspired the global <a href="http://pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a> effort and collaborated on talk proposals</li>
<li>Traveled to Scalathon to organize a <a href="http://workshops.railsbridge.org/2011/06/scala-outreach-workshop/">Scala Crash Course for women and their friends</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Use our materials</h2>

<p>We encourage you to re-use the workshop's teaching materials. Our laptop setup instructions are battle-tested instructions for installing Python on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. Our lecture material introduces basic concepts, and our projects provide hands-on learning.

<p>To find the materials, go to the <a href="events/">list of past events</a> and find the most recent workshop. Each workshop links to the materials we used.</p>

<h2>Get in touch</h2>

<p>Every programming community is different. We'd love to help you bring our success to your part of the world.</p>
