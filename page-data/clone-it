<h2>You can do diversity outreach</h2>

<p>Python programming user groups are often overwhelmingly male. The success of our Workshop shows that you can change this.</p>

<p>We believe our success hinges on:</p>

<ul>
<li>A pool of helpful volunteers</li>
<li>Practical, well-tested projects</li>
<li>Solid documentation for how to set up a development environment</li>
<li>The full support of the Boston Python user group</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more of the <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2011/07/02/lessons-learned-from-the-boston-python-workshop-an-outreach-event-for-women/">lessons we have learned</a> in an article at Geek Feminism.</p>

<p>We love helping other efforts grow, as you can see from <a href="press/">our past collaborations</a>!</p>

<h2>Use our materials</h2>

<p>We encourage you to re-use the workshop's teaching materials. Our laptop setup instructions are battle-tested instructions for installing Python on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. Our lecture material introduces basic concepts, and our projects provide hands-on learning. The material is available for re-use under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons by-sa license</a>.</p>

<p>To find the materials, go to our <a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop/archive">event archives</a> and find the most recent workshop. Each workshop links to the materials we used.</p>

<h2>Get in touch</h2>

<p>Every programming community is different. We'd love to help you bring our success to your part of the world.</p>
