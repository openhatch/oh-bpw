<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The event has resulted in <strong>lasting diversity improvements</strong>
for the Boston Python Meetup. In January 2011, when we began organizing the event,
about 2% of Meetup attendees were women. Since then, 15% or more of our attendees are women. The meetup group's membership has grown to over 1000 people.</p>

<h2>In photos</h2>

<p>Asheesh's Flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulproteus/sets/">contains lots of photos</a> from the events.</p>

<h2>Other efforts</h2>

<p>Since Asheesh <a href="http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4259/pycon-2011-get-new-contributor">spoke about the effort at PyCon 2011</a>, people around the world have started efforts inspired by ours. We've directly collaborated with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Janina at Montreal Python
<li>Dana at PyStar Philadelphia</li>
<li>Audrey at PyLadies LA</li>
<li>Lukas at PyStar San Francisco</li>
<li>Yuvi Masory at Scalathon</li>
</ul>
