<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Our goal is to increase Python community diversity through programming outreach events. Basic programming skills are so empowering and useful that we think everyone should have them. </p>

<p>We strive to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show new programmers and the Boston Python community examples of smart, confident, capable programmers of all backgrounds.</li>
<li>Bring new, awesome, diverse people into local Python programming communities through diversity and outreach events.</li>
<li>Inspire other people to run their own introductory workshops and outreach events, and to get more user groups thinking about diversity and outreach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>About OpenHatch</h2>

<p><a href="https://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a> is an open source community aiming to help newcomers find their way into free software projects.
We organize this event because we believe in bringing more people into open communities, and because
it teaches attendees skills necessary
to participate in open source.</p>
